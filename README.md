# Ciphers

## PRESENT
PRESENT is a lightweight block cipher, developed by the Orange Labs (France), Ruhr University Bochum (Germany) and the Technical University of Denmark in 2007.
The algorithm is notable for its compact size (about 2.5 times smaller than AES).

## Prince
Prince is a block cipher targeting low latency, unrolled hardware implementations.
Its most notable feature is the "alpha reflection": the decryption is the encryption with a related key which is very cheap to compute.
